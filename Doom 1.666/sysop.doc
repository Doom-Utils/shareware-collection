Thanks for carrying DOOM on your BBS. 

Archive Filename:
We prefer you give DOOM a filename of DOOM1666.ZIP.  

Archive Separation:

To help make your life easier we are providing our games in a
format that is easy for you to divide into smaller downloadable
chunks and still be simple for the user to install.  

Extract all the files from the BIG archive and separate them as
detailed:

Archive 1: DOOM16-1.ZIP
FILE_ID.DIZ 
INSTALL.BAT 
DEICE.EXE
*.DAT
*.1

Archive 2: DOOM16-2.ZIP
FILE_ID.DIZ (last line modified to read disk 2/x)
*.2

and so on.

When finished be sure to copy the FILE_ID.DIZ to each archive
and modify it so the last line reflects what number disk the
archive is.
