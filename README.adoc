= Shareware collection

Unpacked and ready-to-play versions of all the id Tech 1 shareware or
demo versions.  This repository was born out of a request to include
downgrade patches in
https://github.com/Doom-Utils/iwad-patches[iwad-patches], but it’s
probably even easier to just have directories to copy to whatever DOS
environment you want, or use the IWADs.

Refer to the https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Shareware[shareware page on
Doom Wiki] for links to all the original installers.
